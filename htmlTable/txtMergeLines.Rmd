txtMergeLines A merges lines while preserving the line break for html/LaTeX

#### Description 

This function helps you to do a multiline table header in both html and in LaTeX. In html this isn’t
that tricky, you just use the <br /> command but in LaTeX I often find myself writing vbox/hbox
stuff and therefore I’ve created this simple helper function

#### Usage 

txtMergeLines(..., html = 5)
22 txtPval

#### Arguments 

... The lines that you want to be joined
html If HTML compatible output should be used. If FALSE it outputs LaTeX formatting.
Note if you set this to 5 then the html5 version of br will be used: <br>
otherwise it uses the <br /> that is compatible with the xhtml-formatting.
Value
string

txtMergeLines("hello", "world", list("A list", "is OK"))
