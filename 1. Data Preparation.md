Data Preparation
==========================

- Grid entered as a 16 times 16 matrix or dataframe.
- The elements are character data objects
- Missing elements are converted to NAs.
- The grid is now ready to go to "list compiling" phase.

<pre><code>
myGrid <- read.csv("myHexadoku.csv")

#Check that the Dimensions are 16 by 16. 
dim(MyGrid)

</code></pre>
